## Task description

| Description and sequence                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generating a matrix of size NxN; N must be greater than or equal to 5;                                                             |
| Filling the matrix with random integers in the range from -100 to 100;                                                             |
| Output of the original matrix to the screen;                                                                                       |
| Counting and output the sum of the elements located on both diagonals;                                                             |
| Counting and output the minimum value among all elements that are above the main diagonal (not including the main diagonal itself);|
| Counting you output the maximum value among all the elements that are below the side diagonal (not including the diagonal itself); |
| Counting and output the number of elements whose values are greater than the arithmetic mean of all elements of the matrix;        |
| Replacing all negative elements of the matrix with their absolute values and output of the modified matrix;                        |
| Replacing all elements that are divisible by 5 with zeros and output of the final matrix;                                          |
